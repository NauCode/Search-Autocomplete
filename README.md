# Search Autocomplete
Some people asked if I could do a search automplete component for my upcoming tutorials about how to use ReactJS, so here it is!

The link to the tutorial will be here once I finished writing and recording all of them, meanwhile you can clone this repo and read the code since it is full of comments explaining everything I do (and why)!

## How to install it?
First, clone the repo:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/NauCode/Search-Autocomplete.git
```

Now enter in the project folder:
``` bash
cd .\search_autocomplete\
```

Install its dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
```

And after that, test it by running:
``` bash
npm start
```
